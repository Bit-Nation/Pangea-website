Pangea Arbitration Token (XPAT): "Pangea Arbitration Token (XPAT)"
The Pangea Arbitration Token (XPAT) is an ERC20 compatible in-app token for the Pangea Jurisdiction. The XPAT token rewards good reputation and is issued on Pangea when Citizens accumulate non-tradable reputation tokens through creating a contract, successfully completing a contract or resolving a dispute attached to a contract. XPAT is an algorithmic reputation token, an arbitration currency based on performance rather than purchasing power, popularity or attention. The distribution mechanism for XPAT tokens on Pangea is an autonomous agent, Lucy, which will initially launch on Ethereum as a smart contract. This mechanism is blockchain agnostic and can be ported to any viable smart contract platform.: "The Pangea Arbitration Token (XPAT) is an ERC20 compatible in-app token for the Pangea Jurisdiction.
