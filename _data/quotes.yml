- text: Bitnation is a very ambitious project. Taking on the government of the nation state on its home field. Challenging it over its core services in free competition.  I have a hard time thinking of anything more disruptive and transformative if it delivers on its potential.

- text: The prospect of decentralizing, privatizing and personalizing law is one of the brightest hopes of the crypto-technological shift. Bitnation is on the cutting edge of something that will shape our future in beautiful ways.

- text: Can we sustain communities where as much of the association and interaction as possible is voluntary, rather than imposed by the laws and regulations that a varyingly imperfect majority is imposing on everybody else? Bitnation is developing a series of applications to achieve that, starting with Pangea.

- text: Who knows where this might end. A representative from something called 'Bitnation' explained to Parallel Polis how an entire nation could one day be provided online via an uncontrollable, uncensorable digital network, where groups of citizens could club together to privately commission public services. Bitnation’s founder, Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, hopes Bitnation could one day replace the nation state and rid us of bureaucrats, creating 'a world of a million competing digital nations', as she later told me.

- text: "Online activists have founded a virtual state called Bitnation. The decentralized organization is designed as an alternative to traditional states. There are no limits, and a wide range of options. Bitnation knows no hierarchies, is autonomous, and is based on voluntary participation. Anyone can join, contribute and offer services. The idea is based on the cryptocurrency bitcoin and the technology that produced the latter: blockchain."

- text: Twitter, Waze, Spotify, Blablacar or Airbnb... These few names are among the references of the Netexplo Forum, which has been benchmarking and rewarding the most innovative digital projects since their inception for the last 10 years. After two days of meetings between entrepreneurs, start-up creators, researchers, philosophers, sociologists, and leaders at UNESCO, the independent organization presented its grand prize 2017 on April 27th. Among a list of ten winners, the public elected Bitnation Refugee Emergency Response (BRER), a Swedish project aimed at restoring an official identity to stateless people, via the blockchain. Thanks to this technology which makes it possible to authenticate and secure virtual transactions, BRER allows undocumented migrants to obtain an official and tamper-proof identity, as well as a Bitcoin payment card, without the need for a bank account.

- text: The first nation distributed everywhere already exists. Bitnation was founded three years ago by the Franco-Swedish Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof. Anyone can be a citizen of Bitnation by simply accepting their Constitution. Doing business there is a very different matter, because that is why you have to build a reputation. Or a bitreputation, to be precise. A good way to do this is to trade in Bitnation and prove little by little that you are a reliable agent. Like real-world nations, Bitnation offers its citizens a demonstrable identity,  (cyber) protection services, a reliable insurance system and a embryonic form of justice. It has already carried some marriages between citizens, granted land titles and issued the first blockchain birth certificate. What else can a nation be asked to provide?
