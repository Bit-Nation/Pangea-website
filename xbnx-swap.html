            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Users that have purchase Bitnation tokens on the Counterparty blockchain should follow these instructions to receive ECR20 XPAT on Ethereum.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To make this swap send your XBNX tokens to the following address:<br><span class="address">17Mm5bpx28FGWXNftPcZ3Dvy8pRoEGQcVg</span></li>
                <li>You must include your email address in the transaction memo field, as in the following example which uses Counterwallet:<br><img class="margin-top-30 drop-shadow" src="{{ "/img/xbnx-swap-example.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Example of XBNX transfer using Counterwallet"></li>
                <li>Send an email from the email address you included on the memo field to <a href="mailto:xbnx@bitnation.co" target="_blank">xbnx@bitnation.co</a> with the Ethereum wallet address where you want to receive yout XPAT.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will receive XPAT at an exchange rate of 1:105. That's the exact division of the total supply of XBNX by the total supply of XPAT. This means you will receive 105 times XPAT the amount of XBNX you send to our address.</p>
